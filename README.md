# 🌀 ULang – A Custom, Comedic & Readable Programming Language

Welcome to **ULang**, a fun and human-friendly programming language I created because... well, I was bored with "normal" projects 😅.  
So I made my own syntax, built an interpreter, and wrapped it in a slick web-based editor.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🗣️ Natural-language-style syntax (write code like you're talking)
- 🖥️ Web-based interpreter (like Replit, but for ULang)
- 🎨 Animated, gradient-based UI with emoji support
- ✍️ Supports print, input, math, conditions, and more

---

## 🧠 Sample ULang Code

```ulang
print Welcome to ULang!
get name
print hello name

remember age is 18
if age is greater than 17 then print you're eligible!
otherwise print not eligible

add 5 to age
multiply age by 2
exit
```

## 🔧 ULang Syntax Reference (Command ➝ Example)

### 🖨️ Print Statements
- `print` ➝ `print hello world`
- `print` ➝ `print hello name`

### 📥 Input
- `get` ➝ `get name`

### 📦 Variables
- `remember` ➝ `remember x is 5`
- `set` ➝ `set y is 10`

### ➕ Arithmetic
- `add` ➝ `add x to y`
- `subtract` ➝ `subtract x from y`
- `multiply` ➝ `multiply x by y`
- `divide` ➝ `divide x by y`

### 🔀 Conditions
- `if` ➝ `if age is greater than 18 then print ok`
- `otherwise` ➝ `otherwise print not ok`

> ✅ Supported Comparisons:
> - `greater than`
> - `less than`
> - `equal to`
> - `not equal`

### 💬 Comments
- `skip` ➝ `skip this is a comment`

### 🛑 Exit
- `exit` ➝ `exit`

## 🧪 Example Project: ULang Calculator

```ulang
get a
get b

print a = a and b = b
add a to b
subtract b from a
multiply a by b
divide a by b
```

## 🖥 How to Run It

1. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in any browser
2. Write ULang code in the left editor
3. Click **Run ULang Code** to see results on the right

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Custom parser/interpreter (no external libraries)
- UI inspired by Replit & VS Code

---

## 🧠 Why I Built This

Because coding should be fun.  
And building your own programming language? Even better.

If you liked this project, feel free to ⭐ the repo or share your own ULang programs!
